# Mathematical Networks Coursework # 

This was my second of two courseworks representing 45% of the course 'Complexity & Networks' - obtaining a grade of 80%. The project involved building a Barabasi-Albert network and growing it using preferential, random and mixed attachment, analysing and comparing the degree distributions of the networks produced with the two methods and their combination.

The repository contains:
- The folder with all working code submitted as the 'Coursework' `./submission_folder` including the coursework report `./submission_folder/networks_report.pdf`
- A file that contains the main code `./main.py`
- A file that contains the mathetmatical models `./model.py`
- A file that tests the mathematical models `./testing_model.py`
- A file that log-bins data `./logbin2020.py`
- A folder with all saved files `./files`
- A directory with all plots produced for the report `./plots`
- A directory with all files from preliminary runs `./old_files`
