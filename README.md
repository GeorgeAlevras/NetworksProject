# Mathematical Networks Coursework # 

Author: George Alevras \

## Description ##
This was my second of two courseworks representing 45% of the course 'Complexity & Networks' - obtaining a grade of 80%. The project involved building a Barabasi-Albert network and growing it using preferential, random and mixed attachment, analysing and comparing the degree distributions of the networks produced with the two methods and their combination.
